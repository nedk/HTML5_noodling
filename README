HTML5 Noodling is a personal repo for, well, noodling with HTML5.

Most of the stuff here is just code fragments I'm using for testing the state of HTML5.
Don't be surprised if things are broken or incomplete, that's to be expected.

Feel free to play along, just leave your best practices at the door. Thank you.
